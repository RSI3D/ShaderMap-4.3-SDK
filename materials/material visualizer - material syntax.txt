SHADERMAP 4.3 : MATERIAL VISUALIZER - MATERIAL XML SYNTAX

The purpose of this document is to provide developers with a method of creating
their own materials inside the ShaderMap Material Visualizer.

Each material is built from an XML script that sets up material properties 
and maps.

A Material uses HLSL shaders in a single Direct3D9 Effect file. The effect (FX) 
file can be embedded in the XML or saved externally and linked to by the XML.

To learn more about DirectX Effect files see the Direct3D9c documentation:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb173329%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb206368%28v=vs.85%29.aspx

or just google it: http://www.google.com/search?q=Direct3D9+Effects

To view all of the default ShaderMap materials look in the ShaderMap following
installation directory, each script is well documented.

<SM_DIRECTORY>\plugins\materials\


================================================================================


All vertices sent to the vertex shaders use the following structure:

struct VS_INPUT
{
     float3 position               : POSITION;
     float3 normal	               : NORMAL;
     float2 uv                     : TEXCOORD0;	
     float4 tangent	               : TANGENT;
};


================================================================================


Below is a basic framework for a Material XML file:


<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>

<shadermap_material version="4.3" loc_trans_title="plugin" loc_trans_default_prefix="en" help_filename="materials\plugin_name.txt" help_default_language="en">

   <setup name="Material Name" description="Material Description">
   
     ... SETUP ELEMENTS HERE ...
   
   </setup>
   
   <fx vsm="3_0" psm="3_0">
   
   <![CDATA[
   
     ... HLSL FX SCRIPT HERE ...
   
   ]]>
   
   </fx>

</shadermap_material>


================================================================================


The <shadermap_material> is the main node for a ShaderMap Material. It includes 
the following attributes:

version                       - The version of the Material File Format, "4.3"
loc_trans_title               - [OPTIONAL] The title for the localization filename   [prefix].[title].txt (located in res\localization)
loc_trans_default_prefix      - [OPTIONAL] The prefix for the localization filename  [prefix].[title].txt (located in res\localization)
help_filename                 - [OPTIONAL] The path to a help file (located in res\localization\help\[help_default_language])
help_default_language         - [OPTIONAL] The 2 letter country code for the default language

If using localization then you can define strings as using |[LOCALIZATION CODE]| inside of quotations ""

--

The first section of the XML is the SETUP <setup> section. Information in this section
defines the maps and properties that the material will use.

The "setup" element requires 2 attributes: "name" and "description".

The second section of the XML is the FX section. This section can include an
entire Direct3D effect script enclosed in the CDATA section or can just be a 
link to a file in the same directory as the XML.

Attributes for the "fx" element are "vsm", "psm", and "file". vsm is the 
minimum vertex shader model required by the material. psm is the minimum pixel 
shader model required. The file attribute is optional, if set the fx is loaded 
from an external file rather than from the CDATA section. 
Ex. file="external_shader.fx"

Because ShaderMap uses DirectX 9c the maximum shader model supported is 
SHADER MODEL 3.


================================================================================


Next is a description of each element that can be included in the SETUP section:

Each possible value for an attribute may be given as "a | b | c". This means it
can be only one of the values divided by the pipe '|' character.


--


<lighting is_active="0 | 1" />

The "lighting" element can be "0" or "1".
It tells ShaderMap to send lighting info from the Visualizer Light control or
not. If it is sent then the following constants are sent to the FX shader:

     // Light data
     int					          g_light_count;
     float3				          g_light_vector_array[4];
     float3				          g_light_color_array[4];
     float                              g_light_specular_array[4];
     float3				          g_light_ambient_color;


--


<world type="matrix | vector | position" fx_name="name_of_fx_constant" />

The "world" element can be of type "matrix", "vector", or "position". This
element tells ShaderMap to send world information about the object it is 
rendering.

Matrix types are sent to the fx_name as float4x4.
Vector types are sent to the fx_name as float3.
Position types are sent to the fx_name as float3.


1. The "matrix" type has the additional attribute "define" which defines the matrix 
to be sent to the fx_name constant. It can be any combination of the following 
characters:

     'w' World matrix
     'v' View matrix
     'p' Projection matrix
     'r' Rotation matrix
     'i' Inverse of matrix
     't' Transpose of matrix
     
     Ex. <world type="matrix" define="wvp" fx_name="world_view_projection" />
     
Each matrix is multiplied by the next. The inverse and transpose are applied to
whatever matrix has previously been created.
     
A string of "wit" sends the world_inverse_transpose matrix
A string of "wvp" sends the world_view_projection matrix
A string of "ri" sends the inversed rotation matrix

Normally there is no scaling in ShaderMap world matrices, all have a scale of 1.
There is one exception to this and that is in the Dynamic Plane default geometry
which is scaled along the ration of the material * the tiling of the material.


2. The "vector" type has the additional attribute "define" which can be any one
of the following values:

     "view" The view vector in world space
     
     Ex. <world type="vector" define="view" fx_name="view_vector_ws" />
     
     
3. The "position" type has the additional attribute "define" which can be on of
the following values:

     "eye"     The eye position in world space
     "target"  The eye target position in world space
     "object"  The object position in world space
     
     Ex. <world type="position" define="object" fx_name="object_position_ws" />

<input type="list | slider | checkbox | color" fx_name="name_of_fx_constant" />

The "input" element defines a property control that will appear in the map
properties section when that map is selected. This element can be a "list", 
"slider", "checkbox" or "color" control. Each type has additional attributes
specific to the type.

Values of the current input are sent to the FX constant defined in "fx_name".

     1. List types are sent to the fx_name as int
     2. Slider types are sent to the fx_name as int
     3. Checkbox types are sent to the fx_name as bool
     4. Color types are sent to the fx_name as float3


1. The "list" type has the additional attributes: "prefix", "items", and 
"default".

     "prefix"  A prefix to the list. A list of colors might use "color: "
     "items"   A list of strings divided by the ; character. "A;B;C"
     "default" The default item in the list. A zero based index (integer).
     
     Ex. <input type="list" prefix="Pre: " items="A;B;C" default="0" fx_name="my_list" />


2. The "slider" type has the additional attributes: "name", "min", "max", and
"default".

     "name"    The name shown next to the slider control
     "min"     The minimum value of the slider (integer)
     "max"     The maximum value of the slider (integer)
     "default" The default value of the slider (integer)     

     <input type="slider" name="Slide It" min="-300" max="300" default="50" fx_name="my_slider" />


3. The "checkbox" type has the additional attributes: "name" and "default"

     "name"    The name shown next to the checkbox control
     "default" The default state 1 or 0.

     Ex. <input type="checkbox" name="Check It" default="1" fx_name="my_checkbox" />
     
     
4. The "color" type has the additional attributes: "name" and "default"

     "name"    The name shown next to the color control
     "default" The default color of the control in HEX format.
     
     Ex. <input type="color" name="Color It" default="ffffff" fx_name="my_color" />

<texture type="map | image | env | env_ir" fx_name="name_of_fx_constant" />

The "texture" element tells ShaderMap to send a texture to ShaderMap. The
texture can be the following types:

     1. map - The user will need to assign a map to this channel.
     2. image - An image file (jpeg, bmp, tga, png, etc) located relative to the material file.
     3. env - The scene environment map. It is an equirectangular map with mipmaps.
     4. env_ir - The scene environment irradiance map.

If any texture is sent to the shader then the tile constant is sent as well. It
is a float2 and is always named g_uv_tile. Multiply this by all texture coords
to get proper tiling.

All textures are sent to the fx_name as texture which should then be used by a
sampler:

     texture                            g_normal_texture;
     
     sampler g_normal_sampler = 
     sampler_state
     {
          Texture                       = <g_normal_texture>;
     };   

     sampler g_env_sampler = 
     sampler_state
     {
          Texture                       = <g_env_texture>;
          MipFilter                     = LINEAR;
          MinFilter                     = LINEAR;
          MagFilter                     = LINEAR;
          AddressU                      = WRAP;                  
          AddressV                      = CLAMP;                 // env and env_ir need to be clamped on V
     };   
    

1. The "map" type texture sends a user defined map to the shader. It has the
additional attributes: "name", "desc", "is_normal", "is_checkbox", and "alt_color".

     "name"         The name of the map required by the shader.
     "desc"         A description of the map required by the shader.
     "is_normal"    Can be either 1 or 0. If set to 1 then the map sent should
                    be a normal map. An additional constant is sent the the FX
                    shader which contains the coordinate system of the normal
                    map. It will take the form <fx_name>_coordsys. It is a
                    float3 vector. It represents the coordinate system relative
                    to the default tangent space used by ShaderMap. A vector
                    of (1,1,1) means it is in X = +Right, Y = +Down, Z = +Near.
                    A value of (1,1,-1) means that Y = +Up
                    
                    You might multiply the tangent space normal by the coordsys
                    constant when extracting from the texture:
                    
                    Ex. normalize(tex2D(g_normal_sampler, IN.uv).rgb * 2.0f - 1.0f) * g_normal_texture_coordsys;
                    
     "is_checkbox"  Can be 1 or 0. If 1 then a checkbox control will be added
                    to the properties that allows the user to disable sending 
                    this texture.

     "alt_color"    [OPTIONAL] A string of 4 bytes representing a default color when a map is not assigned. Ex. "127,127,127,255"
                    
                    
                    Ex. <texture type="map" name="Normal Map" desc="Tangent space normal map is used for bump mapping." fx_name="g_normal_texture" is_normal="1"  is_checkbox="1" />


2. The "image" type texture sends an image from file to the shader. It has the
additional attributes: "name", "file", and "is_checkbox".

     "name"         The name of the image shown only if is_checkbox is 1.
     "file"         The filename of the image to load as a texture. It is 
                    relative to the location of the material file.
                    
     "is_checkbox"  Can be 1 or 0. If 1 then a checkbox control will be added
                    to the properties that allows the user to disable sending 
                    this texture.
                    
                    Ex. <texture type="image" file="res\cel\cel.png" name="Cel Texture" fx_name="g_cel_texture" is_checkbox="0" />


3. The "env" type texture sends the current scene environment map as a mip mapped equirectangular texture.
It has the additional attributes: "is_checkbox".

     "is_checkbox"  Can be 1 or 0. If 1 then a checkbox control will be added
                    to the properties that allows the user to disable sending 
                    this texture.

                    Ex. <texture type="env" name="Environment Map" fx_name="g_env_texture" is_checkbox="0" />


4. The "env_ir" type texture sends the current scene environment irradiance map as an equirectangular texture.
It has the additional attributes: "is_checkbox".

     "is_checkbox"  Can be 1 or 0. If 1 then a checkbox control will be added
                    to the properties that allows the user to disable sending 
                    this texture.

                    Ex. <texture type="env_ir" name="Irradiance Map" fx_name="g_env_ir_texture" is_checkbox="0" />

To sample an equirectangular environment map, use the following HLSL function:

     // Sample an equirectangular environment map - direction is assumed to be normalized
     float4 get_env_sample(sampler env_map, float3 direction, float mip)
     {    return tex2Dlod(env_map, float4(float2(atan2(direction.x, direction.z) * 0.159154943091895, acos(direction.y) * 0.318309886183790), 0.0, mip));
     }
