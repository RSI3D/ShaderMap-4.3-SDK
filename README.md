with 4.3.1 and up. 

This SDK comes with the following APIs for developing plugins and materials for 
ShaderMap 4.3:

* Filter C/C++ API - Use the core CPP file to develop binary filter plugins for 
ShaderMap. Filters are binary Win32 DLL files with the extension SMF. See the 
example source code in the folder "filters/examples". 

* Geometry C/C++ API - Include the core CPP file to develop binary geometry importer
plugins for ShaderMap. Geometry importers are binary Win32 DLL files with the
extension SMG. See the example source code in the folder "geometry/examples". 

* Map C/C++ API - Include the core CPP file to develop binary map plugins for
ShaderMap. Maps are binary Win32 DLL files with the extension SMP. See the 
example source code in the folder "maps/examples". 

* Materials XML/HLSL API - The "materials" folder contains a description of the 
XML + HLSL syntax used to build ShaderMap materials as well as examples for
